This project focuses on analyzing accelerometer data from various human activities (walking, running, climbing up/down) using time series visibility graphs. The dataset consists of sensor readings from different body positions (chest, head) and axes (X, Y, Z). The analysis involves constructing network graphs, computing graph metrics such as average degree and path length, and deriving insights for activity classification.
